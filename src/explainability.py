# Justification:
# - Normalization ensures pixel values are within a consistent range.
# - Standardization improves convergence and performance of the model.
# - Explainability via LIME helps identify important pixels influencing predictions.
# - Insights can refine preprocessing by removing irrelevant features or focusing on key regions.
# - LIME highlights specific pixel regions that contribute most to classification, helping in understanding model decision-making.
# - The most relevant pixels tend to correspond to the edges and textures of the clothing items, which are crucial for distinguishing categories.
# - Based on these insights, future improvements could include feature selection focusing on high-impact pixels or using convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers for better spatial awareness.
